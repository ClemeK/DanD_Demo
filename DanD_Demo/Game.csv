0,"HISTORY - The lawful goodfolk of the Vale of Willow have lived for some eight years in awe and fear of the demi-sorcerer Balthus Dire. In awe - since his power is truly awesome - and in fear even since word leaked from his domain that his ambitious plans of conquest were to commence with the Vale itself. A faithful half-elf sent on a spying mission to the Black Tower came galloping back to the Vale three days ago with a frantic warning. From within the caverns of Craggen Rock, Balthus Dire had recruited an army of Chaotics and was preparing them to attack the vale within weeks. The good King Salamon was a man of action. Messengers were sent throughout the Vale that day to prepare defenses and to summon the menfolk to action. Riders had also been sent to the Great Forest of Yore to warn the half-elves that lived there and to make an appeal for allied forces. King Salamon was also a wise man. He knew well that the news would inevitably reach the Grand Wizard of Yare, a white sorcerer of great power, who lived deep within the forest. The wizaed was old, and would not last through the battle of this magnitude. But he schooled a number of magicians, and perhapes one of his students in the magic arts with courage and ambition would aid the king and his subjects ...
You are the star pupil of the Grand Wizard of Yore. He has been a difficult Master and your own impatience has often got the better of you. Perhapes a little too headstrong, you left immediately for salamon's court. The King welcomed you enthusiacally and explained his plan. The battle could be avoided without bloodshed if Balthus were to be assassinated before his army could be amassed. The mission ahead of you is extremely perilous. Balthus Dire is surrounded, in the Citadel, by a multitude of appalling creatures. Although Magic is your strongest waepon, there will be times when you must rely on your sword to survive. King Salamon has briefed you on your mission and warned you of the dangers that lie ahead. One way through the Citadel is the best for you to take. If you discover it, you will be successful with a minimum of personal risk. It may take you several trips to find the easiest way through. You leave the Vale of Willow on the long hike to the Black Tower. At the foot of the hill of Craggen Rock, you can see its outline against the dark sky ...",>Continue,1,,,,,,
1,"The sun sets. As twilight turns to darkness you start your climb up the hill towards that forbidding shape silhouetted against the night sky. The Citadel is less than an hour's climb. Some distance from its walls you stop to rest - a mistake, as it seems a fearul spectre from which there is no escape. The hairs on your neck pickle as you look towards it. But you are ashamed of your fears. With grim resolve you march onwards towards the main gate, Where you know guards will be waiting. You consider your options. You have already thought aboutclaiming to be a herbalist, come to treart a  guard with a fever. You could pose as a treader or an artisan - perhapes a carpenter. You could even be a nomad, seeking shelter for the night. As you ponder the possibilities, and the yarns you will have to spin to the gaurds, you reach the main trail leading to the gates. Two lanterns burn on either side of the portcullis. You hear muffled gruntings as you approach and two mis-shapen creatures step forward. On then left stands an ugly creature with the head of a dog and the body of and great ape, flexing its powerful arms. Its oppisite number is indeed its opposite, with the head of an ape and the body of a large dog . This latter guard approaches you on all fours. It stops some meters in front of you, raises itself onits hind legs and address you. Which story will you opt for?",>Will you pose as a herbalist?,261,>Will you claim to be a tradesman?,230,>Will you ask for shelter for the night?,20,,
